# Measurability criterion for ennreal-valued functions

Consider a function `f : α → ℝ≥0∞`. If the level sets `{f < p}` and `{q < f}` have measurable
supersets which are disjoint up to measure zero when `p` and `q` are finite numbers satisfying
`p < q`, then `f` is almost-everywhere measurable. This is proved in
`ennreal.ae_measurable_of_exist_almost_disjoint_supersets`, and deduced from an analogous statement
for any target space which is a complete linear dense order, called
`measure_theory.ae_measurable_of_exist_almost_disjoint_supersets`.

Note that it should be enough to assume that the space is a conditionally complete linear order,
but the proof would be more painful. Since our only use for now is for `ℝ≥0∞`, we keep it as simple
as possible.

/-- If a function `f : α → β` is such that the level sets `{f < p}` and `{q < f}` have measurable
supersets which are disjoint up to measure zero when `p < q`, then `f` is almost-everywhere
measurable. It is even enough to have this for `p` and `q` in a countable dense set. -/
