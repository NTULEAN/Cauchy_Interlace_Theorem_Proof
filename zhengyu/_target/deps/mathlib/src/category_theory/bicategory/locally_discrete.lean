# Locally discrete bicategories

A category `C` can be promoted to a strict bicategory `locally_discrete C`. The objects and the
1-morphisms in `locally_discrete C` are the same as the objects and the morphisms, respectively,
in `C`, and the 2-morphisms in `locally_discrete C` are the equalities between 1-morphisms. In
other words, the category consisting of the 1-morphisms between each pair of objects `X` and `Y`
in `locally_discrete C` is defined as the discrete category associated with the type `X ⟶ Y`.

/--
The locally discrete bicategory on a category is a bicategory in which the objects and the
1-morphisms are the same as those in the underlying category, and the 2-morphisms are the
equalities between 1-morphisms.

If `B` is a strict bicategory and `I` is a (1-)category, any functor (of 1-categories) `I ⥤ B` can
be promoted to an oplax functor from `locally_discrete I` to `B`.
