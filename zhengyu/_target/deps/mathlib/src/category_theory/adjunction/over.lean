# Adjunctions related to the over category

Construct the left adjoint `star X` to `over.forget X : over X ⥤ C`.

## TODO
Show `star X` itself has a left adjoint provided `C` is locally cartesian closed.

/--
The functor `over.forget X : over X ⥤ C` has a right adjoint given by `star X`.

Note that the binary products assumption is necessary: the existence of a right adjoint to
`over.forget X` is equivalent to the existence of each binary product `X ⨯ -`.
