# `suggest` and `library_search`

`suggest` and `library_search` are a pair of tactics for applying lemmas from the library to the
current goal.

* `suggest` prints a list of `exact ...` or `refine ...` statements, which may produce new goals
* `library_search` prints a single `exact ...` which closes the goal, or fails

/-- Map a name (typically a head symbol) to a "canonical" definitional synonym.
Given a name `n`, we want a name `n'` such that a sufficiently applied
expression with head symbol `n` is always definitionally equal to an expression
with head symbol `n'`.
Thus, we can search through all lemmas with a result type of `n'`
to solve a goal with head symbol `n`.

For example, `>` is mapped to `<` because `a > b` is definitionally equal to `b < a`,
and `not` is mapped to `false` because `¬ a` is definitionally equal to `p → false`
The default is that the original argument is returned, so `<` is just mapped to `<`.

`normalize_synonym` is called for every lemma in the library, so it needs to be fast.

the application of the other direction. (See `exp_le_exp` in the tests.)

/--
`suggest` tries to apply suitable theorems/defs from the library, and generates
a list of `exact ...` or `refine ...` scripts that could be used at this step.
It leaves the tactic state unchanged. It is intended as a complement of the search
function in your editor, the `#find` tactic, and `library_search`.

`suggest` takes an optional natural number `num` as input and returns the first `num`
(or less, if all possibilities are exhausted) possibilities ordered by length of lemma names.
The default for `num` is `50`.
For performance reasons `suggest` uses monadic lazy lists (`mllist`). This means that
`suggest` might miss some results if `num` is not large enough. However, because
`suggest` uses monadic lazy lists, smaller values of `num` run faster than larger values.

You can add additional lemmas to be used along with local hypotheses
after the application of a library lemma,
using the same syntax as for `solve_by_elim`, e.g.
```
example {a b c d: nat} (h₁ : a < c) (h₂ : b < d) : max (c + d) (a + b) = (c + d) :=
begin
  suggest [add_lt_add], -- Says: `Try this: exact max_eq_left_of_lt (add_lt_add h₁ h₂)`
end
```
You can also use `suggest with attr` to include all lemmas with the attribute `attr`.
-/
meta def suggest (n : parse (with_desc "n" small_nat)?)
  (hs : parse simp_arg_list) (attr_names : parse with_ident_list)
  (use : parse $ (tk "using" *> many ident_) <|> return []) (opt : suggest_opt := { }) :
  tactic unit :=
do (lemma_thunks, ctx_thunk) ← mk_assumption_set ff hs attr_names,
   use ← use.mmap get_local,
   L ← tactic.suggest_scripts (n.get_or_else 50)

/--
`suggest` lists possible usages of the `refine` tactic and leaves the tactic state unchanged.
It is intended as a complement of the search function in your editor, the `#find` tactic, and
`library_search`.

`suggest` takes an optional natural number `num` as input and returns the first `num` (or less, if
all possibilities are exhausted) possibilities ordered by length of lemma names.
The default for `num` is `50`.

`suggest using h₁ h₂` will only show solutions that make use of the local hypotheses `h₁` and `h₂`.

For performance reasons `suggest` uses monadic lazy lists (`mllist`). This means that `suggest`
might miss some results if `num` is not large enough. However, because `suggest` uses monadic
lazy lists, smaller values of `num` run faster than larger values.

An example of `suggest` in action,

```lean
example (n : nat) : n < n + 1 :=
begin suggest, sorry end
```

prints the list,

```lean
Try this: exact nat.lt.base n
Try this: exact nat.lt_succ_self n
Try this: refine not_le.mp _
Try this: refine gt_iff_lt.mp _
Try this: refine nat.lt.step _
Try this: refine lt_of_not_ge _

/--
`library_search` is a tactic to identify existing lemmas in the library. It tries to close the
current goal by applying a lemma from the library, then discharging any new goals using
`solve_by_elim`.

If it succeeds, it prints a trace message `exact ...` which can replace the invocation
of `library_search`.

Typical usage is:
```lean
example (n m k : ℕ) : n * (m - k) = n * m - n * k :=
by library_search -- Try this: exact mul_tsub n m k
```

`library_search using h₁ h₂` will only show solutions
that make use of the local hypotheses `h₁` and `h₂`.

By default `library_search` only unfolds `reducible` definitions
when attempting to match lemmas against the goal.
Previously, it would unfold most definitions, sometimes giving surprising answers, or slow answers.
The old behaviour is still available via `library_search!`.

You can add additional lemmas to be used along with local hypotheses
after the application of a library lemma,
using the same syntax as for `solve_by_elim`, e.g.
```
example {a b c d: nat} (h₁ : a < c) (h₂ : b < d) : max (c + d) (a + b) = (c + d) :=
begin
  library_search [add_lt_add], -- Says: `Try this: exact max_eq_left_of_lt (add_lt_add h₁ h₂)`
end
```
You can also use `library_search with attr` to include all lemmas with the attribute `attr`.

   fail
"`library_search` failed.
If you aren't sure what to do next, you can also
try `library_search!`, `suggest`, or `hint`.

Possible reasons why `library_search` failed:
* `library_search` will only apply a single lemma from the library,
  and then try to fill in its hypotheses from local hypotheses.
* If you haven't already, try stating the theorem you want in its own lemma.
* Sometimes the library has one version of a lemma
  but not a very similar version obtained by permuting arguments.
  Try replacing `a + b` with `b + a`, or `a - b < c` with `a < b + c`,
  to see if maybe the lemma exists but isn't stated quite the way you would like.
* Make sure that you have all the side conditions for your theorem to be true.
  For example you won't find `a - b + b = a` for natural numbers in the library because it's false!
  Search for `b ≤ a → a - b + b = a` instead.
* If a definition you made is in the goal,
  you won't find any theorems about it in the library.
  Try unfolding the definition using `unfold my_definition`.
* If all else fails, ask on https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/,
  and maybe we can improve the library and/or `library_search` for next time."
