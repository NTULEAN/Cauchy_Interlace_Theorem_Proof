# Weak dual topology

This file defines the weak-* topology on duals of suitable topological modules `E` over suitable
topological semirings `𝕜`. The (weak) dual consists of continuous linear functionals `E →L[𝕜] 𝕜`
from `E` to scalars `𝕜`. The weak-* topology is the coarsest topology on this dual
`weak_dual 𝕜 E := (E →L[𝕜] 𝕜)` w.r.t. which the evaluation maps at all `z : E` are continuous.

The weak dual is a module over `𝕜` if the semiring `𝕜` is commutative.

## Main definitions

The main definitions are the type `weak_dual 𝕜 E` and a topology instance on it.

* `weak_dual 𝕜 E` is a type synonym for `dual 𝕜 E` (when the latter is defined): both are equal to
  the type `E →L[𝕜] 𝕜` of continuous linear maps from a module `E` over `𝕜` to the ring `𝕜`.
* The instance `weak_dual.topological_space` is the weak-* topology on `weak_dual 𝕜 E`, i.e., the
  coarsest topology making the evaluation maps at all `z : E` continuous.

## Main results

We establish that `weak_dual 𝕜 E` has the following structure:
* `weak_dual.has_continuous_add`: The addition in `weak_dual 𝕜 E` is continuous.
* `weak_dual.module`: If the scalars `𝕜` are a commutative semiring, then `weak_dual 𝕜 E` is a
  module over `𝕜`.
* `weak_dual.has_continuous_smul`: If the scalars `𝕜` are a commutative semiring, then the scalar
  multiplication by `𝕜` in `weak_dual 𝕜 E` is continuous.

We prove the following results characterizing the weak-* topology:
* `weak_dual.eval_continuous`: For any `z : E`, the evaluation mapping `weak_dual 𝕜 E → 𝕜` taking
  `x'`to `x' z` is continuous.
* `weak_dual.continuous_of_continuous_eval`: For a mapping to `weak_dual 𝕜 E` to be continuous,
  it suffices that its compositions with evaluations at all points `z : E` are continuous.
* `weak_dual.tendsto_iff_forall_eval_tendsto`: Convergence in `weak_dual 𝕜 E` can be characterized
  in terms of convergence of the evaluations at all points `z : E`.

## Notations

No new notation is introduced.

## Implementation notes

The weak-* topology is defined as the induced topology under the mapping that associates to a dual
element `x'` the functional `E → 𝕜`, when the space `E → 𝕜` of functionals is equipped with the
topology of pointwise convergence (product topology).

Typically one might assume that `𝕜` is a topological semiring in the sense of the typeclasses
`topological_space 𝕜`, `semiring 𝕜`, `has_continuous_add 𝕜`, `has_continuous_mul 𝕜`,
and that the space `E` is a topological module over `𝕜` in the sense of the typeclasses
`topological_space E`, `add_comm_monoid E`, `has_continuous_add E`, `module 𝕜 E`,
`has_continuous_smul 𝕜 E`. The definitions and results are, however, given with weaker assumptions
when possible.
