# Topological properties of affine spaces and maps

For now, this contains only a few facts regarding the continuity of affine maps in the special
case when the point space and vector space are the same.

TODO: Deal with the case where the point spaces are different from the vector spaces. Note that
we do have some results in this direction under the assumption that the topologies are induced by
(semi)norms.
