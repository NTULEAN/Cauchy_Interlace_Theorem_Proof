# Checking the sheaf condition on the underlying presheaf of types.

If `G : C ⥤ D` is a functor which reflects isomorphisms and preserves limits
(we assume all limits exist in both `C` and `D`),
then checking the sheaf condition for a presheaf `F : presheaf C X`
is equivalent to checking the sheaf condition for `F ⋙ G`.

The important special case is when
`C` is a concrete category with a forgetful functor
that preserves limits and reflects isomorphisms.
Then to check the sheaf condition it suffices
to check it on the underlying sheaf of types.

When `G` preserves limits, the sheaf condition diagram for `F` composed with `G` is
naturally isomorphic to the sheaf condition diagram for `F ⋙ G`.

If `G : C ⥤ D` is a functor which reflects isomorphisms and preserves limits
(we assume all limits exist in both `C` and `D`),
then checking the sheaf condition for a presheaf `F : presheaf C X`
is equivalent to checking the sheaf condition for `F ⋙ G`.

The important special case is when
`C` is a concrete category with a forgetful functor
that preserves limits and reflects isomorphisms.
Then to check the sheaf condition it suffices to check it on the underlying sheaf of types.

Another useful example is the forgetful functor `TopCommRing ⥤ Top`.

In fact we prove a stronger version with arbitrary complete target category.

As an example, we now have everything we need to check the sheaf condition
for a presheaf of commutative rings, merely by checking the sheaf condition
for the underlying sheaf of types.
