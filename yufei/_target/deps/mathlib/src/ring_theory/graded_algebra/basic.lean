# Internally-graded algebras

This file defines the typeclass `graded_algebra 𝒜`, for working with an algebra `A` that is
internally graded by a collection of submodules `𝒜 : ι → submodule R A`.
See the docstring of that typeclass for more information.

## Main definitions

* `graded_algebra 𝒜`: the typeclass, which is a combination of `set_like.graded_monoid`, and
  a constructive version of `direct_sum.submodule_is_internal 𝒜`.
* `graded_algebra.decompose : A ≃ₐ[R] ⨁ i, 𝒜 i`, which breaks apart an element of the algebra into
  its constituent pieces.
* `graded_algebra.proj 𝒜 i` is the linear map from `A` to its degree `i : ι` component, such that
  `proj 𝒜 i x = decompose 𝒜 x i`.
* `graded_algebra.support 𝒜 r` is the `finset ι` containing the `i : ι` such that the degree `i`
  component of `r` is not zero.

## Implementation notes

For now, we do not have internally-graded semirings and internally-graded rings; these can be
represented with `𝒜 : ι → submodule ℕ A` and `𝒜 : ι → submodule ℤ A` respectively, since all
`semiring`s are ℕ-algebras via `algebra_nat`, and all `ring`s are `ℤ`-algebras via `algebra_int`.

/-- An internally-graded `R`-algebra `A` is one that can be decomposed into a collection
of `submodule R A`s indexed by `ι` such that the canonical map `A → ⨁ i, 𝒜 i` is bijective and
respects multiplication, i.e. the product of an element of degree `i` and an element of degree `j`
is an element of degree `i + j`.

Note that the fact that `A` is internally-graded, `graded_algebra 𝒜`, implies an externally-graded
algebra structure `direct_sum.galgebra R (λ i, ↥(𝒜 i))`, which in turn makes available an
`algebra R (⨁ i, 𝒜 i)` instance.
