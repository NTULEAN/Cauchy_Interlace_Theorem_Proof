# Decision procedure: necessary condition

We introduce a condition `decstr` and show that if a string `en` is `derivable`, then `decstr en`
holds.

Using this, we give a negative answer to the question: is `"MU"` derivable?

### Numerical condition on the `I` count

Suppose `st : miustr`. Then `count I st` is the number of `I`s in `st`. We'll show, if
`derivable st`, then `count I st` must be 1 or 2 modulo 3. To do this, it suffices to show that if
the `en : miustr` is derived from `st`, then `count I en` moudulo 3 is either equal to or is twice
`count I st`, modulo 3.
-/

/--
Given `st en : miustr`, the relation `count_equiv_or_equiv_two_mul_mod3 st en` holds if `st` and
`en` either have equal `count I`, modulo 3, or `count I en` is twice `count I st`, modulo 3.
 -/
def count_equiv_or_equiv_two_mul_mod3 (st en : miustr) : Prop :=
let a := (count I st) in
let b := (count I en) in
b ≡ a [MOD 3] ∨ b ≡ 2*a [MOD 3]

example : count_equiv_or_equiv_two_mul_mod3 "II" "MIUI" :=
or.inl rfl

example : count_equiv_or_equiv_two_mul_mod3 "IUIM" "MI" :=
or.inr rfl

/--
If `a` is 1 or 2 mod 3 and if `b` is `a` or twice `a` mod 3, then `b` is 1 or 2 mod 3.

`count_equiv_one_or_two_mod3_of_derivable` shows any derivable string must have a `count I` that
is 1 or 2 modulo 3.

Using the above theorem, we solve the MU puzzle, showing that `"MU"` is not derivable.
Once we have proved that `derivable` is an instance of `decidable_pred`, this will follow
immediately from `dec_trivial`.

### Condition on `M`

That solves the MU puzzle, but we'll proceed by demonstrating the other necessary condition for a
string to be derivable, namely that the string must start with an M and contain no M in its tail.

`goodm xs` holds if `xs : miustr` begins with `M` and has no `M` in its tail.

end

/-!
We'll show, for each `i` from 1 to 4, that if `en` follows by Rule `i` from `st` and if
`goodm st` holds, then so does `goodm en`.

 The proof of the next lemma is identical, on the tactic level, to the previous proof.

We put togther our two conditions to give one necessary condition `decstr` for an `miustr` to be
derivable.
-/

/--
`decstr en` is the condition that `count I en` is 1 or 2 modulo 3, that `en` starts with `M`, and
that `en` has no `M` in its tail. We automatically derive that this is a decidable predicate.
