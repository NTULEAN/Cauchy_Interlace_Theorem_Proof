# The star operation, bundled as a star-linear equiv

We define `star_linear_equiv`, which is the star operation bundled as a star-linear map.
It is defined on a star algebra `A` over the base ring `R`.

## TODO

- Define `star_linear_equiv` for noncommutative `R`. We only the commutative case for now since,
  in the noncommutative case, the ring hom needs to reverse the order of multiplication. This
  requires a ring hom of type `R →+* Rᵐᵒᵖ`, which is very undesirable in the commutative case.
  One way out would be to define a new typeclass `is_op R S` and have an instance `is_op R R`
  for commutative `R`.
- Also note that such a definition involving `Rᵐᵒᵖ` or `is_op R S` would require adding
  the appropriate `ring_hom_inv_pair` instances to be able to define the semilinear
  equivalence.

then `star` is a semilinear equivalence. -/
