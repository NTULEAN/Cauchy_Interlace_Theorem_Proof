# `nat.upto`

`nat.upto p`, with `p` a predicate on `ℕ`, is a subtype of elements `n : ℕ` such that no value
(strictly) below `n` satisfies `p`.

This type has the property that `>` is well-founded when `∃ i, p i`, which allows us to implement
searches on `ℕ`, starting at `0` and with an unknown upper-bound.

It is similar to the well founded relation constructed to define `nat.find` with
the difference that, in `nat.upto p`, `p` does not need to be decidable. In fact,
`nat.find` could be slightly altered to factor decidability out of its
well founded relation and would then fulfill the same purpose as this file.

/-- The subtype of natural numbers `i` which have the property that
no `j` less than `i` satisfies `p`. This is an initial segment of the
natural numbers, up to and including the first value satisfying `p`.

We will be particularly interested in the case where there exists a value
satisfying `p`, because in this case the `>` relation is well-founded.  -/
