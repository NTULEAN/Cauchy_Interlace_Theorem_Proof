# Abelian categories with enough projectives have projective resolutions

When `C` is abelian `projective.d f` and `f` are exact.
Hence, starting from an epimorphism `P ⟶ X`, where `P` is projective,
we can apply `projective.d` repeatedly to obtain a projective resolution of `X`.

Our goal is to define `ProjectiveResolution.of Z : ProjectiveResolution Z`.
The `0`-th object in this resolution will just be `projective.over Z`,
i.e. an arbitrarily chosen projective object with a map to `Z`.
After that, we build the `n+1`-st object as `projective.syzygies`
applied to the previously constructed morphism,
and the map to the `n`-th object as `projective.d`.
