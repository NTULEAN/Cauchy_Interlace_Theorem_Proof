Tests that the ring instances for `free_algebra` and derived quotient types actually work.

There is some discussion about this in
https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/algebra.2Esemiring_to_ring.20breaks.20semimodule.20typeclass.20lookup/near/212580241

In essence, the use of `attribute [irreducible] the_type` was breaking instance resolution on that
type.
