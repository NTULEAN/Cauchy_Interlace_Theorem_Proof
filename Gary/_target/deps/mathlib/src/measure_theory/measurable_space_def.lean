# Measurable spaces and measurable functions

This file defines measurable spaces and measurable functions.

A measurable space is a set equipped with a σ-algebra, a collection of
subsets closed under complementation and countable union. A function
between measurable spaces is measurable if the preimage of each
measurable subset is measurable.

σ-algebras on a fixed set `α` form a complete lattice. Here we order
σ-algebras by writing `m₁ ≤ m₂` if every set which is `m₁`-measurable is
also `m₂`-measurable (that is, `m₁` is a subset of `m₂`). In particular, any
collection of subsets of `α` generates a smallest σ-algebra which
contains all of them.

Do not add measurability lemmas (which could be tagged with
@[measurability]) to this file, since the measurability tactic is downstream
from here. Use `measure_theory.measurable_space` instead.
