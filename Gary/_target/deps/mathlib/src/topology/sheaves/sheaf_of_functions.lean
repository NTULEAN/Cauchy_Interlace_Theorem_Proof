# Sheaf conditions for presheaves of (continuous) functions.

We show that
* `Top.presheaf.to_Type_is_sheaf`: not-necessarily-continuous functions into a type form a sheaf
* `Top.presheaf.to_Types_is_sheaf`: in fact, these may be dependent functions into a type family

For
* `Top.sheaf_to_Top`: continuous functions into a topological space form a sheaf
please see `topology/sheaves/local_predicate.lean`, where we set up a general framework
for constructing sub(pre)sheaves of the sheaf of dependent functions.

## Future work
Obviously there's more to do:
* sections of a fiber bundle
* various classes of smooth and structure preserving functions
* functions into spaces with algebraic structure, which the sections inherit

We show that the presheaf of functions to a type `T`
(no continuity assumptions, just plain functions)
form a sheaf.

In fact, the proof is identical when we do this for dependent functions to a type family `T`,
so we do the more general case.
