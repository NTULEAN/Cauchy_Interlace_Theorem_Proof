# The category of elliptic curves (over a field or a PID)

We give a working definition of elliptic curves which is mathematically accurate
in many cases, and also good for computation.

## Mathematical background

Let `S` be a scheme. The actual category of elliptic curves over `S` is a large category,
whose objects are schemes `E` equipped with a map `E → S`, a section `S → E`, and some
axioms (the map is smooth and proper and the fibres are geometrically connected group varieties
of dimension 1). In the special case where `S` is `Spec R` for some commutative ring `R`
whose Picard group is trivial (this includes all fields, all principal ideal domains, and many
other commutative rings) then it can be shown (using rather a lot of algebro-geometric machinery)
that every elliptic curve is, up to isomorphism, a projective plane cubic defined by
the equation `y^2+a₁xy+a₃y=x^3+a₂x^2+a₄x+a₆`, with `aᵢ : R`, and such that the discriminant
of the aᵢ is a unit in `R`.

Some more details of the construction can be found on pages 66-69 of
[N. Katz and B. Mazur, *Arithmetic moduli of elliptic curves*][katz_mazur] or pages
53-56 of [P. Deligne, *Courbes elliptiques: formulaire d'après J. Tate*][deligne_formulaire].

## Warning

The definition in this file makes sense for all commutative rings `R`, but it only gives
a type which can be beefed up to a category which is equivalent to the category of elliptic
curves over `Spec R` in the case that `R` has trivial Picard group or, slightly more generally,
when the 12-torsion of Pic(R) is trivial. The issue is that for a general ring R, there
might be elliptic curves over Spec(R) in the sense of algebraic geometry which are not
globally defined by a cubic equation valid over the entire base.

## TODO

Define the R-points (or even A-points if A is an R-algebra). Care will be needed
at infinity if R is not a field. Define the group law on the R-points. (hard) prove associativity.

then this polynomial vanishes iff the cubic curve cut out by this equation is singular. -/
