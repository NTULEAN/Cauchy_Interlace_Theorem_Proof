# Submonoids: definition and `complete_lattice` structure

This file defines bundled multiplicative and additive submonoids. We also define
a `complete_lattice` structure on `submonoid`s, define the closure of a set as the minimal submonoid
that includes this set, and prove a few results about extending properties from a dense set (i.e.
a set with `closure s = ⊤`) to the whole monoid, see `submonoid.dense_induction` and
`monoid_hom.of_mdense`.

## Main definitions

* `submonoid M`: the type of bundled submonoids of a monoid `M`; the underlying set is given in
  the `carrier` field of the structure, and should be accessed through coercion as in `(S : set M)`.
* `add_submonoid M` : the type of bundled submonoids of an additive monoid `M`.

For each of the following definitions in the `submonoid` namespace, there is a corresponding
definition in the `add_submonoid` namespace.

* `submonoid.copy` : copy of a submonoid with `carrier` replaced by a set that is equal but possibly
  not definitionally equal to the carrier of the original `submonoid`.
* `submonoid.closure` :  monoid closure of a set, i.e., the least submonoid that includes the set.
* `submonoid.gi` : `closure : set M → submonoid M` and coercion `coe : submonoid M → set M`
  form a `galois_insertion`;
* `monoid_hom.eq_mlocus`: the submonoid of elements `x : M` such that `f x = g x`;
* `monoid_hom.of_mdense`:  if a map `f : M → N` between two monoids satisfies `f 1 = 1` and
  `f (x * y) = f x * f y` for `y` from some dense set `s`, then `f` is a monoid homomorphism.
  E.g., if `f : ℕ → M` satisfies `f 0 = 0` and `f (x + 1) = f x + f 1`, then `f` is an additive
  monoid homomorphism.

## Implementation notes

Submonoid inclusion is denoted `≤` rather than `⊆`, although `∈` is defined as
membership of a submonoid's underlying set.

Note that `submonoid M` does not actually require `monoid M`, instead requiring only the weaker
`mul_one_class M`.

This file is designed to have very few dependencies. In particular, it should not use natural
numbers.
